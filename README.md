The function takes 3D line in XYZ format and decimation. The function finds circles passing through 3 points (triplet). Triplets are formed by decimated points. 
Decimation stands for points down sampling. I.e. decimation = 1 means that 3 adjacent points are taken, while decimation = 2 means 3 second points are taken. Obviously greater decimation means lower resolution.
Select start/end points of the line and try various decimations.
